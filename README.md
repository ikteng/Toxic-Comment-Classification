# Toxic-Comment-Classification
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/overview

Tutorial: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/toxic-comment-classification-using-bert/

This code essentially performs the following tasks: loading data, preparing the dataset, training a DistilBERT model for toxic comment classification, and providing a way to predict toxicity for user-input comments.

### Things to improve:
1. I wish the training would be faster and more optimized.
